Bugs
====

* [WONTFIX] POP3: downloaded emails have an extra "." at the end
	-> Thunderbird bug!

Improvements
============

* Log4J configuration to send errors by email
	-> remove LOGGER POP3 command as it is SLF4J-specific (or re-work to use reflexion)
* POP3: TOP command is incomplete (only TOP n 0 is supported)
* POP3: DELE, LIST, RETR, UIDL: rfc says argument may NOT refer to a message marked as deleted

New features
============

* POP3: use current client/user in NDC/MDC into logs
* POP3: allow to bind to a specific interface
* POP3: limit the number of simultaneous connections
* POP3: additional commands?
* MBOX: mboxcl and mboxcl2 export
* MAILDIR: maildir++ quota support
* --calendar-- + todos + journal (CalDAV or ics + built-in http server)
* contacts (CardDAV)
* IMAP4rev1 (rfc 3501)

Not doable
==========

* calendar/meeting invites (ics in pop3/mbox/...): no UID information available
